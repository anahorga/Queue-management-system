# Queue Management System  

## Overview  
This application simulates a **multi-queue management system** using **multithreading** and **synchronization mechanisms** to efficiently allocate clients to queues. It ensures **thread safety** through synchronized data structures and logs events in real-time.  

## Features  
✔ **Multithreading** – One thread per queue for parallel processing  
✔ **Thread Synchronization** – Ensures safe data handling  
✔ **Client Allocation Strategies** – Shortest time & shortest queue (Strategy Pattern)  
✔ **Random Client Generator** – Simulates real-world scenarios  
✔ **Graphical User Interface** – Setup simulation & monitor queue evolution  
✔ **Performance Metrics** – Average waiting/service time, peak hour analysis  
✔ **Event Logging** – Stores results in a `.txt` file
